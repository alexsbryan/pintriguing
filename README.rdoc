== Pintriguing

The goal of this project is to clone Pinterest, using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, JQuery, Backbone, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS.

There a few core features:

* Users can create boards from pins, which they can add either from the site, a url, or an uploaded image.

* Users can browse boards by interest tags, or view their home board which has a random compilation of their favorited tags.
